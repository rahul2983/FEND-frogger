### Download and Load
Download the zip file (unzip in your preferred location) or clone the repo (in your preferred location). Open the `index.html` file in your browser. The game will load and you can now play my version of Frogger :)

### Game Objective
The grid is laid out as grass (green blocks), rocks (grey blocks) and water (blue blocks). Your mission to get to the water without getting attacked by a bug as many times as possible. You have a total of 5 lives and everytime you run into a bug you lose one.

### How to play?
1. Choose a character from the player icons listed at the top by clicking on anyone of them
2. Use Arrow Keys to move around the grid

### How to score?
1. Everytime you reach the water you score 10 points.
2. There are several Gems that pop up during the game at random locations. If you are able to capture these gems (by moving your character on the same tile as the gem) you score 10 (Blue), 15 (Green) or 20 (Orange) points.
3. You have only 5 lives throughout the game but if you capture a Heart (shows up at random locations) you get additional +1 life

### How the game ends?
The game ends when you have 0 lives left. A message pops up showing your grand score.

## How to restart the game?
Once the game has ended just close the screen or click the Play Again button
